Thus, universal screening is a critical feature of preventative service delivery models that identify students at risk and provide early support for reading difficulties. As schools choose assessment tools for this purpose, three aspects of universal screening tools are especially important to consider: appropriateness for the intended use, technical adequacy, and usability. Using these standards for assessment review, this study investigated two screening tools commonly used to identify first-graders at risk for reading failure: the Aimsweb Tests of Early Literacy (TEL) and Reading Curriculum Based Measurement- Reading (R-CBM), and the Developmental Reading Assessment-Second Edition (DRA2), an informal reading inventory (IRI). First, test materials were examined for evidence of alignment to important constructs of interest, usability, and technical adequacy. A questionnaire was employed to gather information from twelve first-grade educators from four elementary schools in one diverse suburban district about decisions made using data from each assessment. Finally, to examine predictive validity, an important aspect of technical adequacy, scores on each screening tool as well as third-grade outcome measures were analyzed for 269 students in the participating district.</p>\n<p>Results indicated that the TEL measures were more closely aligned to early reading constructs of interest than the DRA2, and also demonstrated more efficient usability characteristics. However, the educator questionnaire revealed that both assessments are endorsed by teachers for the purpose of screening. While both tools are indeed predictive of later reading achievement, neither resulted in adequate classification accuracy to be recommended for use as a stand-alone screening tool. In addition, the DRA2 resulted in high levels of problematic false negative screening results, meaning that it under identifies students at risk, potentially neglecting students\u2019 access to timely intervention. Analysis of classification accuracy for subgroups including English language learners and students eligible for free and reduced lunch revealed that classification accuracy varies by subgroup membership, affecting the predictive validity of screening tools with these populations. Implications for practice and future research are addressed.</p>\n", "configured_field_t_department": ["School Psychology", "School Psychology", "School Psychology", "School Psychology"], "discipline_terminal_key": [1072], "configured_field_t_oai_document_type": ["dissertation", "dissertation"], "document_type": ["openaccess", "Open Access Dissertation", "Open Access Dissertations"], "author": ["Amadee Meyer"], "ancestor_key": ["12464443", "5111417", "179873", "1"], "virtual_ancestor_link": ["http://digitalcommons.bepress.com", "http://researchnow.bepress.com", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/etds", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2"], "author_userid": [2806838], "configured_field_t_degree_year": ["2018"], "author_display_lname": ["Meyer"], "discipline": ["Psychology", "School Psychology", "Social and Behavioral Sciences"], "institution": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "author_display": ["Amadee Meyer"], "configured_field_t_award_month": ["September", "September"], "configured_field_t_advisor": ["Amanda M.

Arrays consist of chemotaxis receptor trimers of dimers that are bridged at their membrane-distal tips by rings of two cytoplasmic proteins, a kinase CheA and a coupling protein CheW. It is widely accepted that ligand binding to the receptor causes a 2 \u00c5 piston motion of a helix that extends through the periplasmic and transmembrane domains. However, it is not clear how the signal propagates 200 \u00c5 further to control activity of the kinase bound at the tip of the receptor. Dynamic changes within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor have been proposed to play a key role in signal transmission. To test these proposals, we applied solid-state NMR to study the structure and dynamics of the <em>E coli</em> Asp receptor cytoplasmic fragment (U-<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N-CF) in native-like arrays of functional complexes with CheA and CheW. To detect segments that experience motions on the millisecond time scale, we use a <sup>15</sup>N{<sup>13</sup>C} REDOR filter to remove signals from rigid backbone carbons and retain signals from backbone carbons with ms-timescale dynamics. This experiment exhibits only 60-70% of the expected REDOR dephasing, suggesting that 40-30% of the backbone has ms-timescale mobility that averages the ~ 1000 Hz <sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N dipolar couplings. A novel REDOR-filtered DARR experiment led us to identify MH2 (methylation helix 2) as the region with ms-timescale motion. INEPT spectra reveal dynamics on the ns or shorter timescale. The INEPT-detectable regions are identified through a combination of biochemical and NMR approaches, to establish that MH1 (methylation helix 1) is mobile on the ns timescale. Interestingly, the INEPT and REDOR studies indicate the methylation region has asymmetric mobility: MH1 has ns-timescale dynamics that increase in the kinase-off state, and MH2 has ms-timescale dynamics that decrease in the kinase-off state. Thus these NMR measurements of the dynamics of CF within its functional complexes provide insight into the structural organization and signaling-related changes of the receptor methylation region, which is responsible both for transmitting the ligand-binding signal and for adaptation, both of which are critical to the chemotaxis response.</p>\n", "configured_field_t_department": ["Biochemistry", "Biochemistry", "Biochemistry", "Biochemistry"], "discipline_terminal_key": [1], "configured_field_t_oai_document_type": ["dissertation", "dissertation"], "document_type": ["openaccess", "Open Access Dissertation", "Open Access Dissertations"], "author": ["Maryam Kashefi"], "ancestor_key": ["13480210", "5111417", "179873", "1"], "virtual_ancestor_link": ["http://digitalcommons.bepress.com", "http://researchnow.bepress.com", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/etds", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2"], "author_userid": [2925082], "configured_field_t_degree_year": ["2019"], "author_display_lname": ["Kashefi"], "discipline": ["Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology", "Life Sciences"], "institution": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "author_display": ["Maryam Kashefi"], "configured_field_t_award_month": ["February", "February"], "configured_field_t_advisor": ["Prof. Lynmarie Thompson"], "discipline_key_1": [1], "configured_field_t_orcid": ["N/A"], "discipline_key_0": [1016], "author_inst": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "virtual_ancestor_key": ["81989", "82034", "693940", "5111417", "179873"], "discipline_1": ["Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology"], "discipline_0": ["Life Sciences"], "configured_field_t_advisor1": ["Prof. Lynmarie Thompson"], "ancestor_link": ["http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/1487", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu", "http:/"], "configured_field_t_degree_name": ["Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)", "Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)"]}, {"dc_or_paid_sw": true, "institution_title": "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "url": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/1106", "exclude_from_oai": false, "publication_key": "5111417", "site_key": "179873", "parent_key": "5111417", "context_key": "10687634", "title": "REGULATED PROTEOLYSIS OF DNAA COORDINATES CELL GROWTH WITH STRESS SIGNALS IN CAULOBACTER CRESCENTUS", "fulltext_url": "https://scholarworks.umass.edu/context/dissertations_2/article/2169/viewcontent", "publication_link": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2", "publication_date": "2017-11-01T18:10:57Z", "mtime": "2021-04-20T20:41:32Z", "publication_title": "Doctoral Dissertations", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7275/10687634.0", "include_in_network": true, "parent_link": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2", "is_digital_commons": true, "download_format": "pdf", "download_link": "https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2169&context=dissertations_2", "peer_reviewed": false, "site_link": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu", "embargo_date": "1970-01-01T00:00:01Z", "fields_digest": "16e77d302750d5650b3cdd8081e2c3f9acde3996", "abstract": "<p>DNA replication is an essential process in all domains of life. Replication must be precisely regulated, especially at the step of initiation. In bacteria, the replication initiator DnaA is regulated by multiple post-translational regulations to ensure timely replication. <em>Caulobacter crescentus</em> has the most strict replication regulation that DNA only replicates once per cell cycle, and proteolysis of DnaA identified in this species is the only irreversible way to inhibit DnaA, suggesting it might be pivotal to restricting DNA replication. However, the responsible protease(s) and mechanism for its degradation remain unclear since its first discovery in 2005. In this thesis, I describe the efforts to characterize the proteolysis regulation on <em>C. crescentus</em> DnaA. I identified and characterized DnaA degradation by two different proteases, Lon and ClpAP. Lon is the dominant protease for DnaA degradation, and my work on this degradation revealed a novel allosteric regulation mechanism by which Lon links unfolded substrate concentration with DnaA proteolysis, and provides a way for Lon to rapidly eliminate DnaA and arrest replication during proteotoxic stress. Mechanistic studies of Lon-dependent degradation shows that a complicated mechanism governs the recognition and degradation of DnaA, including the existence of multiple degradation determinants and the dependency of DnaA activity state. In contrast, ClpAP plays an auxiliary role on DnaA degradation, but this degradation is enhanced during nutrient starvation stress. Interestingly, Lon degrades DnaA more rapidly when it is in a complex with DnaA loaded on the replication origin DNA, but a specific structure of DNA, G-quadruplex, strongly inhibits general substrate degradation by Lon. Taken together, the studies in this thesis revealed the complex mechanisms on DnaA degradation in <em>Caulobacter crescentus</em>, and provided insights on how cells interrogate proliferation status in changing environments by modulating the levels of a replication factor.</p>\n", "configured_field_t_department": ["Biochemistry", "Biochemistry", "Biochemistry", "Biochemistry"], "discipline_terminal_key": [49, 2, 10, 5], "configured_field_t_oai_document_type": ["dissertation", "dissertation"], "document_type": ["openaccess", "Open Access Dissertation", "Open Access Dissertations"], "author": ["Jing Liu"], "ancestor_key": ["10687634", "5111417", "179873", "1"], "virtual_ancestor_link": ["http://digitalcommons.bepress.com", "http://researchnow.bepress.com", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/etds", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2"], "author_userid": [2483677], "configured_field_t_degree_year": ["2017"], "author_display_lname": ["Liu"], "discipline": ["Bacteriology", "Biochemistry", "Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology", "Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology", "Cell and Developmental Biology", "Cell Biology", "Life Sciences", "Life Sciences", "Life Sciences", "Life Sciences", "Microbiology", "Molecular Biology"], "institution": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "author_display": ["Jing Liu"], "configured_field_t_award_month": ["September", "September"], "configured_field_t_advisor": ["Peter Chien"], "discipline_key_2": [49, 2, 10, 5], "discipline_key_1": [1, 8, 48], "configured_field_t_orcid": ["N/A"], "discipline_key_0": [1016], "discipline_2": ["Bacteriology", "Biochemistry", "Cell Biology", "Molecular Biology"], "author_inst": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "virtual_ancestor_key": ["81989", "82034", "693940", "5111417", "179873"], "discipline_1": ["Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology", "Cell and Developmental Biology", "Microbiology"], "discipline_0": ["Life Sciences"], "configured_field_t_advisor1": ["Peter Chien"], "ancestor_link": ["http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/1106", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu", "http:/"], "configured_field_t_degree_name": ["Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)", "Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)"]}, {"dc_or_paid_sw": true, "institution_title": "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "url": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/1161", "exclude_from_oai": false, "publication_key": "5111417", "site_key": "179873", "parent_key": "5111417", "context_key": "11222982", "title": "Effects of Aerobic Physical Activity on Student Engagement: Can 20 Minutes of Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity Affect On-task Classroom Behavior Immediately Following?", "fulltext_url": "https://scholarworks.umass.edu/context/dissertations_2/article/2215/viewcontent", "publication_link": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2", "publication_date": "2018-03-21T16:18:07Z", "mtime": "2021-04-20T20:39:15Z", "publication_title": "Doctoral Dissertations", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7275/11222982.0", "include_in_network": true, "parent_link": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2", "is_digital_commons": true, "download_format": "pdf", "download_link": "https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2215&context=dissertations_2", "peer_reviewed": false, "site_link": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu", "embargo_date": "1970-01-01T00:00:01Z", "fields_digest": "f94e4c484d10d1a6bffe9fa9fa54d67e61c75edb", "abstract": "<p>Converging evidence suggests moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) has positive effects on cognitive performance.

Student behavior has been consistently identified as one of the greatest stressor\u2019s teachers deal with and is a significant predictor of burnout development (Chang, 2013). For the prevention and management of behavioral challenges, it is essential that teachers use evidence-based practices. However, research indicates that classroom management practices are frequently not implemented with sufficient implementation fidelity to be effective, even with didactic training by consultants (Briere et al., 2015). Burnout and self-efficacy are constructs that are rarely incorporated into the understanding of implementation efforts and barriers. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to evaluate if there is a relationship between teacher experienced levels of burnout and self-efficacy, and the self-reported implementation status and perceived importance of evidence-based behavior management practices. Teachers (<em>N </em>= 64) completed measures of burnout and self-efficacy and rated 27 critical evidence-based classroom management practices on perceived importance to teaching and status of implementation. A subset of participants (<em>N </em>= 11) were interviewed on their thoughts and experiences related to burnout, self-efficacy, and classroom management. The results showed that classroom management self-efficacy significantly predicted implementation status, and none of the variables were significant predictors of perceived importance. Qualitatively, teachers identified 24 themes and 14 subthemes. A predominant idea from the qualitative findings showed that teachers need support with behavior management, and this can come in many forms such as enhancing administrator support, parent and community support, teacher appreciation, or providing professional development. Through providing this support to teachers\u2019 schools can help reduce their experienced stress, support self-efficacy development, and potentially help prevent the development of burnout. Findings lead to several suggestions for future research.</p>\n", "configured_field_t_department": ["School Psychology", "School Psychology", "School Psychology", "School Psychology"], "discipline_terminal_key": [798], "configured_field_t_oai_document_type": ["dissertation", "dissertation"], "document_type": ["openaccess", "Open Access Dissertation", "Open Access Dissertations"], "author": ["Autumn Jillson"], "ancestor_key": ["18052972", "5111417", "179873", "1"], "virtual_ancestor_link": ["http://digitalcommons.bepress.com", "http://researchnow.bepress.com", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/etds", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_harvesting"], "author_userid": [3394448], "configured_field_t_degree_year": ["2020"], "author_display_lname": ["Jillson"], "discipline": ["Education", "Educational Psychology"], "institution": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "author_display": ["Autumn Jillson"], "configured_field_t_award_month": ["September", "September"], "configured_field_t_advisor": ["Sarah Fefer"], "discipline_key_1": [798], "configured_field_t_orcid": ["https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5999-2970</p>"], "discipline_key_0": [784], "author_inst": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "virtual_ancestor_key": ["81989", "82034", "12428490", "693940", "5111417", "179873"], "discipline_1": ["Educational Psychology"], "discipline_0": ["Education"], "configured_field_t_distribution_license": ["Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 4.0", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"], "configured_field_t_advisor1": ["Sarah Fefer"], "ancestor_link": ["http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/2033", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu", "http:/"], "configured_field_t_degree_name": ["Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)", "Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)"]}, {"dc_or_paid_sw": true, "institution_title": "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "url": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/668", "exclude_from_oai": false, "publication_key": "5111417", "site_key": "179873", "parent_key": "5111417", "context_key": "8438348", "title": "\u201cRace talk\u201d in Organizational Discourse: A Comparative Study of Two Texas Chambers of Commerce", "fulltext_url": "https://scholarworks.umass.edu/context/dissertations_2/article/1721/viewcontent", "publication_link": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2", "publication_date": "2016-07-13T14:41:04Z", "mtime": "2021-04-20T20:41:28Z", "publication_title": "Doctoral Dissertations", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7275/8438348.0", "include_in_network": true, "parent_link": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2", "is_digital_commons": true, "download_format": "pdf", "download_link": "https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&context=dissertations_2", "peer_reviewed": false, "site_link": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu", "embargo_date": "1970-01-01T00:00:01Z", "fields_digest": "02a4ae8028d267b87f21a0d515cd3c9acd2358a5", "abstract": "<p>This dissertation takes an interpretive, discursive approach to understanding how organizational members create meanings about race, and other identities, through their everyday communication practices in the workplace. This dissertation also explores how these everyday discourses about race might reproduce, negotiate, or challenge ideologies that maintain the dominant position of Whiteness in United States racial hierarchies. I draw from data collected during eight months of ethnographic fieldwork (from Jan-Aug 2014) with two chambers of commerce in a large Texas city: an Asian American Chamber of Commerce (AACC) and what I call the \u201cNorth City\u201d Chamber of Commerce (NCC). The AACC explicitly identifies with a racial group, while the NCC identifies with a geographic region (\u201cNorth City\u201d) associated with a White affluent identity.</p>\n<p>Discourse analysis of audio and video recorded data gathered during fieldwork illustrates that, in this community, there are two prevalent discourses about race. One form of \u2018race talk\u2019 \u2013 practiced by Asians, minorities more generally, and White people who work with minority groups \u2013 can be characterized as explicitly addressing race as constitutive of professional identities. A second form of race talk, practiced by White NCC members, can be characterized as not explicitly discussing race and therefore implicitly invoking White identity as constitutive of professional identities. Overall, these forms of race talk illustrate how Asian identity is constructed as foreign, local, and diverse, and White identity is constructed as an invisible, non-raced identity and as an authentic, Texan identity. Furthermore, these forms of race talk reproduce boundaries between White and non-White businesses and position Whiteness as the normal, taken for granted professional identity, and minority identities as marked, \u2018other\u2019 identities in the business community.</p>\n", "configured_field_t_department": ["Communication", "Communication", "Communication", "Communication"], "discipline_terminal_key": [372, 627, 329, 331, 322, 335, 426, 323], "configured_field_t_oai_document_type": ["dissertation", "dissertation"], "document_type": ["openaccess", "Open Access Dissertation", "Open Access Dissertations"], "author": ["Natasha Shrikant"], "ancestor_key": ["8438348", "5111417", "179873", "1"], "virtual_ancestor_link": ["http://digitalcommons.bepress.com", "http://researchnow.bepress.com", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/sbs", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/Communication", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/communication_diss", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/etds", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2"], "author_userid": [2331061], "configured_field_t_degree_year": ["2016"], "author_display_lname": ["Shrikant"], "discipline": ["Anthropological Linguistics and Sociolinguistics", "Anthropology", "Anthropology", "Business", "Business and Corporate Communications", "Communication", "Communication", "Communication", "Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Ethnicity in Communication", "International and Intercultural Communication", "Linguistic Anthropology", "Linguistics", "Organizational Communication", "Race and Ethnicity", "Social and Behavioral Sciences", "Social and Behavioral Sciences", "Social and Behavioral Sciences", "Social and Behavioral Sciences", "Social and Behavioral Sciences", "Social and Behavioral Sciences", "Social and Behavioral Sciences", "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "Sociology"], "institution": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "author_display": ["Natasha Shrikant"], "configured_field_t_award_month": ["May", "May"], "configured_field_t_advisor": ["Benjamin Bailey"], "discipline_key_2": [372, 329, 331, 322, 335, 426, 323], "discipline_key_1": [318, 627, 325, 371, 416], "configured_field_t_orcid": ["N/A"], "discipline_key_0": [622, 316], "discipline_2": ["Anthropological Linguistics and Sociolinguistics", "Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Ethnicity in Communication", "International and Intercultural Communication", "Linguistic Anthropology", "Organizational Communication", "Race and Ethnicity", "Social and Cultural Anthropology"], "author_inst": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst"], "virtual_ancestor_key": ["180160", "205585", "81989", "82034", "188288", "693940", "5111417", "179873"], "discipline_1": ["Anthropology", "Business and Corporate Communications", "Communication", "Linguistics", "Sociology"], "discipline_0": ["Business", "Social and Behavioral Sciences"], "configured_field_t_advisor1": ["Benjamin Bailey"], "ancestor_link": ["http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/668", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2", "http://scholarworks.umass.edu", "http:/"], "configured_field_t_degree_name": ["Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)", "Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)"]}, {"dc_or_paid_sw": true, "institution_title": "University of Massachusetts Amherst", "url": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/311", "exclude_from_oai": false, "publication_key": "5111417", "site_key": "179873", "parent_key": "5111417", "context_key": "6227020", "title": "The Semiosis of Civil Society: Theorizing the Media in Postcolonial Polities", "fulltext_url": "https://scholarworks.umass.edu/context/dissertations_2/article/1298/viewcontent", "publication_link": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2", "publication_date": "2015-03-17T17:09:56Z", "mtime": "2021-04-20T20:40:15Z", "publication_title": "Doctoral Dissertations", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.7275/6227020.0", "include_in_network": true, "parent_link": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2", "is_digital_commons": true, "download_format": "pdf", "download_link": "https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1298&context=dissertations_2", "peer_reviewed": false, "site_link": "http://scholarworks.umass.edu", "embargo_date": "1970-01-01T00:00:01Z", "fields_digest": "368ed0d7971a0d9d0fe65e341e45d46cfe951fe7", "abstract": "<p>My dissertation is an attempt to construct a theoretical framework for the distinctive nature of the mass media in the postcolonial political context through an engagement with the theoretical legacy of Indian political theory and historiography, especially the Subaltern Studies school. I draw from Partha Chatterjee\u2019s conceptualization of Indian politics as divided into the two spheres of civil and political society and interpret these political categories through the rubric of mass media and televisual discourse, both to locate the mass media in the discourse and practice of politics, and to also locate political practice as it takes place in a mediatized context.</p>\n<p>To extend Chatterjee\u2019s understanding of the postcolonial polity, I map these political categories to Jean Baudrillard\u2019s understanding of human communication that is divided between the symbolic and semiotic domains. I trace Baudrillard\u2019s theoretical trajectory from Durkheim and Marx through social anthropology and media theory. I also try to interpret his categories through Marx\u2019s concept of the subsumption of labor under capital as a metaphor to understand how the thread of capitalist modernity runs through them.</p>\n<p>I posit that the nation-form is the essential embodiment of capitalist modernity in the context of a mediatized political sphere where the nation is essentially what Baudrillard calls a simulacrum, and I try to understand it as a semiotic discourse that is located within the realm of civil society. I explore this aspect of the relationship between media and politics through instances of the mass-mediation of the symbolic domain of political society.</p>\n<p>Finally I argue that it is the symbolic domain that is the dominant aspect of communication in the postcolonial context, and it is a recovery of the symbolic that will provide a political challenge radical enough to destabilize the semiotic realm of capitalist modernity. This recovery can only take place if the mass media shifts its location from civil society to the democratic challenges of political society. A radical theory of the media in the postcolonial context will be one that will enable this shift by critically engaging with the absences and silences of the symbolic within current media discourse.</p>\n", "configured_field_t_department": ["Communication", "Communication", "Communication", "Communication"], "discipline_terminal_key": [328, 334], "configured_field_t_oai_document_type": ["dissertation", "dissertation"], "document_type": ["openaccess", "Open Access Dissertation", "Open Access Dissertations"], "author": ["Srinivas R.

In the valorization of Rumi, the engagement of distinct discourses that emerged out of complex histories stand out. This study, accordingly, seeks to contextualize the ways in which Sufism, as well as Rumi\u2019s works and thoughts, are being read and discussed in relation to discourses on Islam, religion, and spirituality so as to explore the \u201cpolitics of representation\u201d that is embedded in those refractions.</p>\n<p>The dissertation analyzes the representations of Sufis, Sufism, and consequentially Rumi in a wide variety of texts, from pre-modern proto-ethnographic works to contemporary translations and novels, so as to trace the construction and engagement of discourses that engender the most significant readings of Rumi. The representation of Rumi\u2019s \u201cMuslimhood\u201d constitutes the focus of analysis. For several decades, and due to a variety of reasons that are discussed in this study, Rumi was imagined merely as an incidental Muslim in the West, where the spiritual currents of the second half of the twentieth century cast him as a New Age guru with romantic sensibilities. It was only in the early twenty-first century, with the events of 9/11 and the consequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Rumi\u2019s Muslim identity has come to be acknowledged on a popular level.</p>\n<p>The dissertation interrogates the discursive course of the assessment of Rumi as an extra-Islamic figure and the contemporary re-evaluation as an Islamic one, and thereby sheds light on the post-9/11 discourses on Islam in the West, within which Rumi in particular has been cast as an ideal(ized) representative of \u201cgood Muslims.\u201d It is argued that that Rumi\u2019s \u201cideality\u201d is largely an effect of the New Age reading of Rumi, which underlines, among other things, the compatibility of Rumi\u2019s spirituality with Western values.</p>\n", "configured_field_t_department": ["Comparative Literature", "Comparative Literature", "Comparative Literature", "Comparative Literature"], "discipline_terminal_key": [454], "configured_field_t_oai_document_type": ["dissertation", "dissertation"], "document_type": ["openaccess", "Open Access Dissertation", "Open Access Dissertations"], "author": ["FATMA B.
